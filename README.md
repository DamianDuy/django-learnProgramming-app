# Team Project

The overall goal of this application is to provide users an easy way to monitor their progress in learning custom programming languages. The road map of learning the chosen programming language will divide the learning path into the most important sections. At the end of each section the user will take part in a short test to check if they obtained the required knowledge to proceed.

The supported programming languages include:<br />
-C++

More programming languages will be added later.

The user can also indicate, which sections were the most difficult or the most engaging. Based on the users' answers the statistics will be made.

This application is meant to be used by anyone who learns programming and needs an extra motivation or the progress tracking.
